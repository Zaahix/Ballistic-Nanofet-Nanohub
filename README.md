# Ballistic Nanofet Simulation – NanoHub

## 📘 Project Title
**Temperature and Length-Dependent Parametric Study of Ballistic Nanofet using NanoHub Simulations**

## 🧠 Summary
This project presents a simulation-based study of nanoscale ballistic field-effect transistors (Nanofets), exploring how **channel length (5 nm, 10 nm, 15 nm)** and **temperature (200 K, 300 K, 400 K)** impact key device performance metrics such as:
- On/Off current (Ion/Ioff)
- Subthreshold Swing (SS)
- DIBL
- Threshold voltage (Vth)

## ⚙️ Tools Used
- [NanoHub Simulation Platform](https://nanohub.org)
- Origin software for graphing Id–Vd & Id–Vg
- Microsoft Word (for report writing)

## 📊 Key Findings
- 5 nm device has highest Ion at 200 K (1500 μA/μm), but suffers severe short-channel effects.
- 10 nm channel is optimal at 300 K for balancing performance and leakage.
- 15 nm offers best electrostatics (SS ~ 65 mV/dec), ideal for low-power applications.
